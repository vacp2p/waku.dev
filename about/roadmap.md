Waku v1 is in production and was quickly adopted by the Status Mobile application. Yet, this initial version was unable to handle the scale required to support popular applications, prompting the v2 rewrite. Waku v2 has seen encouraging initial adoption beyond Status by projects such as Railgun's private transaction system, The Graph's indexer communication network Graphcast and the messaging platform XMTP. 

Given Waku v1's scaling difficulties, the team behind Waku is primarily focused on ensuring v2 scales securely. By the end of Q2 2023, we aim to support more than one million users. 

Meanwhile, the team is also working on ensuring production readiness alongside network and development sustainability. Although work on these areas is already underway, our efforts will intensify as we progress toward our million-user-milestone. Finally, Waku aims to promote itself among developers looking to add decentralized communications to their applications.

## Secure scalability

Alongside Vac researchers, Waku is producing and implementing various RFCs to define the protocols and application guidelines required to serve more than one million simultaneous users. We then aim to study Waku's capacity through network simulations before designing and implementing scalability risk-mitigation strategies. 

## Production readines

We will consider Waku v2 production ready when it's performant, stable and bug-free while satisfying user requirements. This process will involve collaboration with Status teams to test the protocols, and further simulations to assess future updates' expected performances. Ensuring that Waku has adequate protection against spam and DoS attacks is critically important to this milestone. 

## Network sustainability

Many of Waku's core value propositions—privacy and resistance to censorship, for example—are reliant on its decentralization. While our most passionate users may well operate network infrastructure altruistically, incentivization mechanisms will ensure a wider node distribution and, thus, strengthen Waku's more disruptive properties. 

This process will involve defining a viable incentivization structure via RFC and studying its efficacy to tweak parameters through test net simulations before implementation on the main net. 

## Development sustainability

We believe Waku will only realize its true potential if its community and users believe in its longevity. As such, Waku's development must remain funded. Again, arriving at a suitable funding mechanism will involve several RFCs to define how much of the network's extractable value can be diverted toward R&D efforts.

## Growth

After achieving the above milestones, we will be in a position to aggressively market Waku to potential contributors and developers within the web3 sector and beyond. As a piece of public goods infrastructure, we encourage the wider community to help improve the protocols by contributing to our R&D efforts. 

Promotion is an ongoing process that is already underway, involving conference attendance and sponsorship, hosting developer workshops, producing promotional material, and appearing on industry-focused podcasts.

## Roadmap rationale

Completing the roadmap objectives described above will best position Waku for maximum user adoption. Proving Waku is scalable and reliable must come before subsequent milestones as the network's non-functionality will discourage infrastructure operators regardless of the incentive structure we put in place. 

Similarly, it makes little sense to promote Waku aggressively until we are confident that it can handle waves of new users without degraded performance. Without first achieving secure scalability and proving production readiness, it will be very difficult to convince all but the most ideologically driven developers to continue believing in Waku's potential if their first experience is a negative one.
