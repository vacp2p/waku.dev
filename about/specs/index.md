Waku builds a family of privacy-preserving, censorship-resistant communication protocols for web3 applications. This repository contains specifications for the Waku suite of protocols.

## List of Specifications

- Standards
  - Core: Standards and protocols for the core Waku p2p communications offering.
  - Application: Standards and protocols that describe various applications or encryption use cases built on top of a Waku network.
- Informational: Waku design issues, general guidelines or background information that does not constitute a new feature.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome from any party. Contributors can create specifications relating to the Waku domain and create a pull request to begin discussion. The recommended [template](https://github.com/waku-org/specs/blob/master/template.md) may be used for new proposed specifications.

New specifications are considered a proof of concept. Once a rough consensus is reached towards stabilization, the specification may be considered to receive the draft status and further discussion will continue on the [Vac RFC-Index](https://github.com/vacp2p/rfc-index) repository.

**NOTE**: Specifications located in this repository should be considered not production ready. Discussion should be conducted with the intention of maturing each specification.
