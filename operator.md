# Run a Waku Node

By running your own node you provide additional nodes for the Waku Network.

In the future, we intend to design and implement incentivization within some Waku protocols,
so you can be rewarded when supporting the network.

Check out [the nwaku guide for operators](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku/tree/master/docs/operators) to run your own node.
