Or is there a particular reason why it makes most sense to be part of the UI for the local node?\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo reasons. i) is privacy, if we (waku or status) host this app then everyone registering will leak their ip with their index to us. ii) is that we dont have to run that infra, less stuff to maintain. Also, if we ship this with waku then the process of registering the membership and configuring waku with it can be done in one go via the UI. Out of scope by now, but aiming to reduce friction in RLN registration. Note that we cant refer as \\"dapp\\" here. The dapp is the contract, but if someone interacts with that \\"dapp\\" via us, well, its still a dapp in some sense, but privacy is lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n> so it may make more sense to spend time on promoting these than building an over-simplified version to only push and receive a message if we could have a full set of APIs covered available?\\r\\n\\r\\nYup, guess it is like postman. But note that this feature focuses on non tech savy users. The goal is not to support every api endpoint, but offer a very simple and curated UI thats abstract complexity even further. I indeed thin its better to build a \\"over-simplified version\\". Example, im sure redocly won\'t be integrated nicely with subscribing to msg (simple textbox that keeps printing the latest messages)\\r\\n","createdAt":"2023-08-16T11:29:37Z"},{"id":"IC_kwDOJvts2M5kLDRy","author":{"login":"vpavlin","avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4759808?u=d045a41a43fa2deabfc3115236cc1e8b0509b164&v=4"},"body":"> if we (waku or status) host this app then everyone registering will leak their ip with their index to us\\r\\n\\r\\nHow?

The app will allow users to create and participate in voting polls on various topics collected from [public APIs](https://rapidapi.com/search/polls%2Bapi).\\r\\n2. **Integrating Waku**: I will integrate the `@waku/sdk` into the application to enable secure and private communication between users to facilitate the exchange of poll-related data, such as voting choices and results while maintaining anonymity.\\r\\n3. **Deployment**: The web app will be deployed on IPFS or another permissionless decentralized storage solution. I will also provide clear instructions for running the app locally.\\r\\n4. **Documentation**: I will write a comprehensive blog guide that takes readers through the process of building the voting poll web app. The guide will be aimed at developers and will include detailed explanations, screenshots and code samples.\\r\\n5. **Twitter Thread**: I will create a Twitter thread to explain how the web app utilizes Waku for private, decentralized communications. This thread will tag the \\"@Waku_org\\" Twitter account and provide insights into why Waku is a reliable choice for building this/similar solution(s).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Timeline \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f:\\r\\n- Week 1: Designing the UI and setting up the Vue.js project structure.\\r\\n- Week 1: Implementing the Waku integration for core communication features and testing the app.\\r\\n- Week 2: Documenting the development process, creating the blog guide, and preparing the Twitter thread.\\r\\n- Week 3-4: Finalizing the project, deploying the web app on IPFS, and submitting all deliverables.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Relevant Work \ud83d\udcbc:\\r\\nWhile I don\'t have previous experience with Waku, I have extensive experience in web development and as a technical writer.
