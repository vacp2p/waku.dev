# Waku Docs

Waku is a decentralized, censorship-resistant, network and protocol family.
It enables you to add communication features to your dApp in a decentralized manner,
ensuring to your users that they will not be censored or de-platformed.

Waku can be used for chat purposes and for many machine-to-machine use cases.

Finally, if you want to learn how Waku works under the hoods, check the specs at [rfc.vac.dev](https://rfc.vac.dev/).
