Runs anywhere.\n\n[Check the docs](https://js.waku.guide/)\n\n## What is Waku?\n\nWaku is a suite of privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer messaging protocols.\n\nWaku **removes centralized third parties** from messaging,\nenabling private, secure, censorship-free communication with no single point of failure.\n\nWaku **provides privacy-preserving** capabilities,\nsuch as sender anonymity,metadata protection and unlinkability to personally identifiable information.\n\nWaku is designed for **generalized messaging**, enabling human-to-human, machine-to-machine or hybrid communication.\n\nWaku runs everywhere: desktop, server, including **resource-restricted devices**, such as mobile devices and browsers.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThe first version of Waku had its origins in the Whisper protocol,\nwith optimizations for scalability and usability.\nWaku v2 is a complete rewrite.\nIts relay protocol implements pub/sub over libp2p, and also introduces additional capabilities:\n\n1. Retrieving historical messages for mostly-offline devices.\n2. Adaptive nodes, allowing for heterogeneous nodes to contribute.\n3. Bandwidth preservation for light nodes.\n\nThis makes it ideal for running a p2p protocol on mobile, or in other similarly resource-restricted environments.\n\n[Read the RFCs](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/10/)\n\n## Use Waku Now\n\nYou can\n\n- [Run a Waku node](/operator)\n- [Integrate Waku in your application](/platform)\n- [Contribute to Waku](/contribute)\n\n## Who is using Waku?\n\n### Status\n\nStatus is a secure messaging app, crypto wallet, and Web3 browser built with state-of-the-art technology.\n\n[Visit Status](https://status.im/)\n\n### RAILGUN\n\nRAILGUN is a privacy system for Ethereum that shields your assets in your own smart contract wallet.\nRAILGUN uses Waku when offering the ETH gas payments to other users,\nprivately signaling fees and offers for gas payment relayers to keep the privacy & anonymity of your stablecoin & token transactions.\n\n[Visit RAILGUN](https://railgun.org/)\n\n### XMTP\n\nXMTP is using Waku v2 for their open protocol and network for secure web3 messaging.\n\n[Visit XMTP](https://xmtp.com/)\n\n## Implementations\n\n### nwaku\n\nA nim implementation of the Waku v2 protocol.\nReference client and flagship implementation.\n\n[nwaku repository](https://github.com/waku-org/nwaku)\n\n### js-waku\n\nA JavaScript implementation for browser environments.\n\n[js-waku docs](https://js.waku.guide/)\n\n### go-waku\n\nA Go implementation for native integration in go applications,\nC-Bindings are also available with C#, Swift and Kotlin examples.\n\n[go-waku repository](https://github.com/waku-org/go-waku)\n\n### @waku/react-native\n\nIntegrate Waku in your React Native app using go-waku for mobile.\n\n[@waku/react-native repo](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-react-native)\n\n### Waku Rust Bindings\n\nRust layer on top of go-waku C FFI bindings.\n\n[waku-rust-bindings repo](https://github.com/waku-org/waku-rust-bindings)\n","metadata":{"title":"Main page"},"toc":[{"content":"What is Waku?","slug":"what-is-waku","lvl":2,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"How does it work?","slug":"how-does-it-work","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Use Waku Now","slug":"use-waku-now","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Who is using Waku?","slug":"who-is-using-waku","lvl":2,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Status","slug":"status","lvl":3,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"RAILGUN","slug":"railgun","lvl":3,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"XMTP","slug":"xmtp","lvl":3,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Implementations","slug":"implementations","lvl":2,"i":7,"seen":0},{"content":"nwaku","slug":"nwaku","lvl":3,"i":8,"seen":0},{"content":"js-waku","slug":"js-waku","lvl":3,"i":9,"seen":0},{"content":"go-waku","slug":"go-waku","lvl":3,"i":10,"seen":0},{"content":"@waku/react-native","slug":"waku-react-native","lvl":3,"i":11,"seen":0},{"content":"Waku Rust Bindings","slug":"waku-rust-bindings","lvl":3,"i":12,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Main page"},"navOrder":1686020923.177,"localPath":"main.md","path":[],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{}},"__N_SSG":true}
